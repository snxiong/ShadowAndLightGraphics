Completed operation in Lab RVR5029 on Machine: XCOM

My program has 3 objects that is represented by a
	1) brick texture jaded material pyramid, object imported
	2) earth texture peral material torus
	3) ice texture bronze material sphere
that satsfiy the 3 different object and the use of 2 different texture and 2 different material requirement also the requirement to use 1 imported  model.

The light source that is represented by a small sphere satisfy the requirement of the global ambient light.

The light source that is represented by the small sphere is able to move in the XYZ direction satisfying the controllable positional light requirement.

The 3 objects all cast shadows on each other that satisfy the requirement that 1 object must cast a shadow on at least 1 object.

The camera can move in the XYZ direction and can pan up, down, right, and left to satisfy the viewing control requirement
